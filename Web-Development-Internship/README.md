This is the repository of an one #unpaid and #unfair Internship program.

## Internship Task To Perform
- [x] **Portfolio Website**: A portfolio website made up of HTML, CSS telling about you and your accomplishments.
- [x] **Temperature Converter**: Create a simple website using CSS, HTML, JAVASCRIPT to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and etc.
- [ ] **Homepage of Netflix**: A simple website having a similar homepage to that of Netflix using HTML and CSS.

### These are the 3 tasks given by them to complete and I need to complete at least 2 task for certification but internship when internship about to end they demand money to claim certificate, I feel this is #unfair so I leave that internship as it is.
Anyways, at the end of the day I got learn about web development for free of costðŸ˜†.
