            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Namaskar Hello!</b><br>
                I am <b>Sarvesh Ashok Devrukhakar</b>, a passionate and dedicated developer with a strong foundation in
                C/C++, Java, and Python. With a flair for creativity and problem-solving, I am always eager to explore
                new technologies and contribute to impactful projects. My journey into the world of technology began
                with an eagerness to learn and grow, and I have been fortunate to gain experience in various aspects of
                development.
                <br><br>
                Currently, pursuing my <b>Bsc.IT</b> from <b>Pune Vidyarthi Grihaâ€™s College</b> in Mumbai, I am
                committed to honing my skills and creating a positive impact through my work. My expertise extends to
                Object-Oriented Programming, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and Database Management Systems, and
                I have also delved into web development using Django.
                <br><br>
                I believe in the power of collaboration and open-source contributions. I actively participated in
                Hacktoberfest 2022, where I contributed to open-source projects on GitHub. I take pride in my Platinum
                Badge on Sololearn, a coding platform that reflects my dedication to continuous learning.
                <br><br>
                Outside of the tech realm, you'll find me indulging in hobbies like sketching and documenting my
                thoughts.
                I'm also an avid podcast listener, always seeking new perspectives and insights.
                <br><br>
                Feel free to connect with me if you need help regarding my niche
                <br><br>
                <b>Let's explore the digital world together and Let's code, collaborate, and create!</b>
