  <h1>About This <code>EASY-TO-C0DE</code> Repository</h1>
  <p>
    This is the repository of all the source codes when I start my coding journey in April 2020 (Lockdown).<br/>
    I think this is not helpful for other people because here are just my old practice source codes.<br/>
    If you want to explore more, then you can but you'll find things helpful (I think so).<br/>
    So, if you are reading this then you are in the right place.:sweat_smile:<br/>
    This Repository is for recruiters who want to see how much I have practised yet.:fire::smile:
