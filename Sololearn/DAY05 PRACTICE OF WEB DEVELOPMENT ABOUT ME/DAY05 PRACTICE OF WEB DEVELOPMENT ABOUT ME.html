        <p>Hello Everyone,<br />My Name is SARVESH. Now iam studying in second year of BSC.IT. i like to learn skills and i really like that.<br />This SOLOLEARN app is amazing for beginners, Those who wants to learn basic about some languages, they can learn here for free.<br /><br />After my HSC, i desided to take admission in BCA, but because of some reason i cancel that decision and take admission in BSC.IT. But before that during summer vacation, when i talk with my friend (anurag singh) he tells me if you wants to start your coding journey then you can download this this application and start your learning.</p>
